== INSTALLATION

    script/plugin install git://github.com/kannanr/acts_as_solr_reloaded.git

== REQUIREMENTS

* Java Runtime Environment(JRE) 1.5 aka 5.0 [http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp](http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp)
* If you have libxml-ruby installed, make sure it's at least version 0.7

== CONFIGURATION

Configuration is done in the config/solr.yml file. If you need a Solr server, you can clone this jetty-solr project:

http://github.com/dcrec1/jetty-solr

== USAGE

Just include the line below to any of your ActiveRecord models:
  acts_as_solr

Or if you want, you can specify only the fields that should be indexed:
  acts_as_solr :fields => [:name, :author]

Then to find instances of your model, just do:
  Model.search(query) #query is a string representing your query
  
Case you want to use dynamic attributes or geolocalization, you can use this generators that setup the database:

  script/generate dynamic_attributes_migration
  script/generate local_migration
  
and then configure your model like this:

  acts_as_solr :dynamic_attributes => true,
               :spatial => true
               
If you want to integrate the model with acts_as_taggable_on, just add the option :taggable => true :

  acts_as_solr :taggable => true

Please see ActsAsSolr::ActsMethods for a complete info

== PAGINATION

In your controller:

  @search = Product.search "beer", :page => 2, :per_page => 20

And in your view:

  will_paginate @search

== TESTING

To test code that uses acts_as_solr_reloaded you must start a Solr server for the test environment and also start MongoDB.
